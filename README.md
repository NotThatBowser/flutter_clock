# Circle Clock

A clock created for the Flutter Clock challenge.

Shaded circles representing hour, minute and second hands move across the screen, while the background flows through the colour spectrum every hour.

This creates an ever-changing landscape throughout the day as the circles interact to create contrasting colours and interesting patterns. The clock gives an indication of the time at a glance and a readout is provided for precision.

## Supported Settings

* **24 Hour** - The readout changes as required.
* **Light/Dark** - The tone of the colours reflect the theme.
