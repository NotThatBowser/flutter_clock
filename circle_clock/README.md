# Circle Clock

The clock animates shaded circles (representing hour, minute and second hands) across the screen, while the background animates through the colour spectrum each hour.

This creates an ever-changing landscape throughout the day as the circles interact to create contrasting colours. The circles give an indication of the time at a glance and a readout is provided for precision.

## Supported Customizer Settings

* **24 Hour** - The readout changes as required.
* **Light/Dark** - The tone of the colours reflect the theme.

## Licenses

* **Code** - A MIT license is provided at ./LICENSE
* **Assets** - The font 'Quicksand' is used and its OFL license is provided at assets/fonts/quicksand/OFL.txt
